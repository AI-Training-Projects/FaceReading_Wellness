We want to investigate the hypothesis that human "face reading" can be used AI to detect or confirm underlying medical conditions.  

Hypothesis: Face Reading can be used as an accurate and reliable predictor of human health.

Can Face Reading be used as an accurate and reliable predictor of human health? 

To formulate a investigational project outline, initially we want to articulate the hypothesis, flesh out the "best" questions and types of questions to ask, define data science experiments to prove or disprove the hypothesis, find previous work done in the AI and medical community, then find datasets for doing experiments, and report on the results.

Let's start with the most important questions to ask.  We first want to arrive at the right set of questions that will guide the prompt engineering and prompt optimization to arrive at a concise.  

What work has been done on human "face reading" to use AI to detect underlying medical conditions?  

Search the literature to find publications from the most reputable medical journals, arxiv.org, paperswithcode, and similar publications at the intersection of medicine, science, AI, software engineering.
